Modern Arts Data Cleaning with Pandas

This project uses Pandas in Python to clean and preprocess a modern arts dataset.

The dataset contained inconsistent formatting, missing values, and unnecessary symbols, which were cleaned to prepare it for further analysis.

📌 Key Cleaning Steps:

✔ Cleaned Gender Column – Standardized values, removed special characters, and replaced missing values with "Gender Unknown".

✔ Standardized Nationality Column – Removed extra symbols and replaced missing values with "Nationality Unknown".

✔ Formatted Date Columns (BeginDate & EndDate) – Extracted only numeric values, removed unwanted characters like (, c, C, ., s, ' ).

✔ Handled Missing Values – Used Boolean indexing to replace empty fields with appropriate labels.

✔ Converted BeginDate & EndDate to Float – Ensured date fields were numerical for further analysis.
